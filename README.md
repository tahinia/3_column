## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts


### What I learned

From this section I learned how I can center image sources in the middle of the grid columns and also how to center the grid in the middle of the page.
I am happy that I still remember most of what CSS and HTML code to use to design the website and most of the editing was down to the padding/margin.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
I need to look more into refining my ability to use media queries and also approach different ways of using grids.
